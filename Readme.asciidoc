Hexameter
=========

This is the Common Lisp/Poem implementation of the Hexameter
communication protocol.

Hexameter provides a portable implementation of the SCEL communication
primitives (`get`, `put`, `qry`).  It uses ZeroMQ as message transport
and encodes payloads using JSON; it is therefore easy to write
bindings for different languages.  

This implementation provides two different tuple-space variants:
`memory-space` is a simple memory-based hash table that stores tuples;
`blackboard-space` uses a http://gbbopen.org/[GBBOpen] blackboard as
tuple space and can therefore serve particularly well as interface to
the _Iliad_ runtime for _Poem_.

In addition to this implementation a
https://github.com/thomasgabor/hexameter[Lua-based implementation] is
available.  A JavaScript/Node implementation exists but is currently
not publicly available.  Contact tc@xantira.com for further details.

More complete documentation will be provided shortly.
